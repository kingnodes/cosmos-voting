# JUNO PROPOSAL 11
## Keplr wallet native integration

Kingnodes have votes YES

We believe that native integration to Keplr is a required milestone for the success of Juno. Having native integration into the Keplr mobile application will greatly increase the potential user base for the token. This will also assist in helping airdrop recipients discover their $JUNO.

While some believe the price for the integration is high, as discussed at commonwealth.im, this fee will include customised development to support cosmwasm coins in the Keplr application, as well as highly performing backend infrastructure.
